    <h1>TRAVEL WITH YOUR DOG</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <em>Travel with your dog</em>. As a dog lover and owner, I have often struggled with travels just like many people like me. 
    Many places are not accessible for your best friend. And organizing your trips can be challenging. For this reason, we have decided to create this website. 
    Travel with your dog can allow you to directly input your destination and find out which places can accomodate you and your furry best friend. 
    You can find here establishments as well as public places that you can discover with your best friend. 
    Enough said, let's find out more about your next destination.</p>
